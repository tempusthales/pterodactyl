# Pterodactyl How to Guides

These guides are more for me, than for you.  Meaning that you are more than welcome to use them, but the only reason I write them is to remember how I do things i 
don't do often. If you find an error feel free to open an issue and I will fix.

Also Never substitute what the folks at Pterodactyl have written in  their guides for the things you see here, as this is very specific to the way I do things.

Always double check with their documentation:
